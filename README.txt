The DS18x20_Temperature directory contains an Arduino sketch from the DS18x20 
Library Examples located at: http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire.
The DS18B20Simple directory contains a stripped-down version of the example
from the DS18x20_Temperature sketch which only, under normal circumstances, sends
the temperature in Fahrenheit to the USB-tethered host once a second in order to test 
the host-based Processing sketch, GraphEx2.pde
